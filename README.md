📱 SwagLab-Appium

An automated mobile testing project built using Appium and TestNG 🚀

🔹 About the Project

This project focuses on testing the SwagLab mobile application to ensure its features work correctly under different scenarios (both ✅ positive and ❌ negative).

Throughout this project, I worked with:

Eclipse IDE 🖥️ — project setup and development

Java ☕ — test automation scripting

TestNG 🧪 — structuring, organizing, and managing test cases

Extent Reports 📊 — generating rich, visual HTML reports for test execution

🔹 What I Learned

✔️ Writing and executing mobile UI tests with Appium
✔️ Structuring test cases and managing execution flow with TestNG
✔️ Handling mobile gestures, locators, and validations
✔️ Reporting results with detailed logs and screenshots using Extent Reports

🔹 Reporting

I integrated Extent Reports to provide a professional and visually descriptive HTML report that makes it easy to analyze test results at a glance.

Example highlights:

Pass/Fail test indicators

Execution timestamps

Logs and screenshots for debugging
